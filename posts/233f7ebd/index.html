<p>浏览器输入【docker主机ip:81】，成功进入web页面，初次登录使用邮箱：<a href="mailto:&#97;&#100;&#x6d;&#x69;&#x6e;&#x40;&#x65;&#120;&#97;&#109;&#x70;&#108;&#101;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#97;&#100;&#x6d;&#x69;&#x6e;&#x40;&#x65;&#120;&#97;&#109;&#x70;&#108;&#101;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>，密码：changeme。<br><img src="/images/使用docker搭建nginx-proxy-manager实现反向代理和SSL证书申请/通过docker安装nginx proxy manager 01.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload /></p>
<p>登录进去后会让你设置管理员的用户名（Full Name），昵称（Nickname）和邮箱。<br><img src="/images/使用docker搭建nginx-proxy-manager实现反向代理和SSL证书申请/通过docker安装nginx proxy manager 02.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload width="60%" /></p>
<p>接下来设置密码，旧密码即预设密码changeme。<br><img src="/images/使用docker搭建nginx-proxy-manager实现反向代理和SSL证书申请/通过docker安装nginx proxy manager 03.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload width="60%" /></p>
<p>至此，nginx proxy manager初始化完成。</p>
<h2 id="使用nginx-proxy-manager实现反向代理"><a href="#使用nginx-proxy-manager实现反向代理" class="headerlink" title="使用nginx proxy manager实现反向代理"></a>使用nginx proxy manager实现反向代理</h2><p>登录进入主面版，点击Proxy Hosts转到反向代理设置界面。<br><img src="/images/使用docker搭建nginx-proxy-manager实现反向代理和SSL证书申请/nginx proxy manager反向代理 01.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload /></p>
<p>点击Add Proxy Host，添加一个反向代理。<br><img src="/images/使用docker搭建nginx-proxy-manager实现反向代理和SSL证书申请/nginx proxy manager反向代理 02.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload /></p>
<p>在Details页面，Domain Names填写你的域名，Scheme填写反代对象的协议（http&#x2F;https），Forward Hostname&#x2F;IP填写反代对象的地址，Forward Port填写反代对象的端口号。</p>
<p><code>Domain Names</code> - 填写需要反代的域名<br><code>Scheme</code> - 选择来源的协议<br><code>Forward Hostname / IP</code> - 填写来源的主机名或IP<br><code>Forward Port</code> - 填写来源的端口<br><code>Cache Assets</code> - 是否启用缓存<br><code>Block Common Expoits</code> - 阻止常见的漏洞<br><code>Websockets Support</code> - 是支援 Websockets<br><code>Access List</code> - 权限列表选择，可以给反代的网页设置账户密码，验证通过后才能正常打开</p>
<img src="/images/使用docker搭建nginx-proxy-manager实现反向代理和SSL证书申请/nginx proxy manager反向代理 03.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload width="60%" />

<p>如果有https加密需求，转到SSL页面，将SSL Certificate选择为你申请的证书，建议勾选SSL Force（强制SSL）。<br><img src="/images/使用docker搭建nginx-proxy-manager实现反向代理和SSL证书申请/nginx proxy manager反向代理 04.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload width="60%" /></p>
<p>点击保存，在反向代理页面可以看到刚刚设置的反向代理。<br><img src="/images/使用docker搭建nginx-proxy-manager实现反向代理和SSL证书申请/nginx proxy manager反向代理 05.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload /></p>
<p>测试相应网站，反代成功。</p>
<h2 id="SSL证书申请"><a href="#SSL证书申请" class="headerlink" title="SSL证书申请"></a>SSL证书申请</h2><h3 id="HTTP-01-验证方式"><a href="#HTTP-01-验证方式" class="headerlink" title="HTTP-01 验证方式"></a>HTTP-01 验证方式</h3><p>最简单常规的SSL证书申请方式，如果你的主机可以放行80端口（如在各大公有云处购买的主机），推荐使用这种方式。<del>我这边没有虚拟主机，家用80端口也被封锁了，所以也没用过这种方式，姑且放在这里给大家参考_(:3」∠)_</del></p>
<p>转到反代编辑页面，在SSL页面选择Request a new SSL Certificate，建议勾选SSL Force（强制SSL），打开勾选I Agree to the Let’s Encrypt Terms of Service同意Let’s Encrypt相关条款，点击保存。<br><img src="/images/使用docker搭建nginx-proxy-manager实现反向代理和SSL证书申请/nginx proxy manager设置SSL证书 HTTP-01.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload width="60%" /></p>
<p>可以看到反代已自动申请SSL证书，可以通过https访问了。证书有效期3个月，到期会自动续期。</p>
<h3 id="DNS-01-验证方式"><a href="#DNS-01-验证方式" class="headerlink" title="DNS-01 验证方式"></a>DNS-01 验证方式</h3><p>因为国内ISP一般都封锁了80端口，所以HTTP-01验证方式大概率在家庭自建服务器的情况下不会成功。作为替代，我们可以选择使用DNS-01的验证方式来申请SSL证书。相较于HTTP-01，DNS-01可以申请<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://letsencrypt.org/zh-cn/docs/challenge-types/">支持通配符的域名证书</a>，也算弥补了其操作繁琐的缺点。这里以DNSPOD和CloudFlare为例：</p>
<h4 id="·-DNSPOD"><a href="#·-DNSPOD" class="headerlink" title="· DNSPOD"></a>· DNSPOD</h4><h5 id="1-申请api-key"><a href="#1-申请api-key" class="headerlink" title="1. 申请api key"></a>1. 申请api key</h5><p>首先登录DNSPOD控制台，在右上角找到 API密钥 项。<br><img src="/images/使用docker搭建nginx-proxy-manager实现反向代理和SSL证书申请/DNSPOD API申请 01.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload width="50%" /></p>
<p>转到 DNSPod Token 页面，点击创建密钥。<br><img src="/images/使用docker搭建nginx-proxy-manager实现反向代理和SSL证书申请/DNSPOD API申请 02.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload width="60%" /></p>
<p>设置密钥名称<br><img src="/images/使用docker搭建nginx-proxy-manager实现反向代理和SSL证书申请/DNSPOD API申请 03.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload width="60%" /></p>
<p>查看并保存ID和Token项，这里的内容<b>只会显示一次</b>，一定要保存好。<br><img src="/images/使用docker搭建nginx-proxy-manager实现反向代理和SSL证书申请/DNSPOD API申请 04.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload width="60%" /></p>
<p>已经能在总览看到相关API已申请成功。<br><img src="/images/使用docker搭建nginx-proxy-manager实现反向代理和SSL证书申请/DNSPOD API申请 05.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload /></p>
<h5 id="2-配置nginx-proxy-manager并申请SSL证书"><a href="#2-配置nginx-proxy-manager并申请SSL证书" class="headerlink" title="2. 配置nginx proxy manager并申请SSL证书"></a>2. 配置nginx proxy manager并申请SSL证书</h5><p>点击SSL Certificates，转到SSL Certificates页面；再点击右上角Add SSL Certificate，选择Let’s Encrypt。<br><img src="/images/使用docker搭建nginx-proxy-manager实现反向代理和SSL证书申请/nginx proxy manager设置SSL证书 DNS-01 01.png" srcset="/img/loading.gif" lazyload /></p>
<p>如下图，Domain names填写自己的域名，Email Address for Let’s Encrypt填写自己的邮箱。</p>
<p>打开Use a DNS Challenge，DNS Provider选择DNSPod，将dns_dnspod_email中的<a href="mailto:&#101;&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#64;&#x65;&#120;&#x61;&#109;&#112;&#x6c;&#101;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;">&#101;&#x6d;&#97;&#105;&#x6c;&#64;&#x65;&#120;&#x61;&#109;&#112;&#x6c;&#101;&#x2e;&#x63;&#111;&#x6d;</a>替换为DNSPod的邮箱，dns_dnspod_api_token中的id,key对应填入（即在上一步申请得到的id和token），注意不要删掉英文双引号，且id与token用英文逗号连接。</p>
<figure class="highlight ini"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><code class="hljs ini"><span class="hljs-attr">dns_dnspod_email</span> = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;email@example.com&quot;</span><br><span class="hljs-attr">dns_dnspod_api_token</span> = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;id,key&quot;</span><br></code></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
